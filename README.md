# cmdMail
An app that responds to commands via email and performs tasks autonomously.

### Dependencies / Installation
Raspian and most other Linux distros come with Python 3, which is all you need to run the main cmdMail program.
You will also need a valid GMail account for the Pi to listen to.

This program is meant as a skeleton or sample program to get started with automated tasking and using emails to control a computer.
You can add many other features by extending this program to call out to external programs and scripts.

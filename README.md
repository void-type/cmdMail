# cmdMail-Python
An email reading app designed for a Linux headless server. Can respond to email requests and start threaded commands.

### Dependencies / Installation
Raspian and most Linux distros come with Python 3, which is all you need to run the main cmdMail program.
cmdMail uses external program "streamripper" and needs to point to bash scripts that run the streamripper command.
You will also need a valid Gmail account for the Pi to listen to.

This program is meant as a skeleton or sample program to get started with automated tasking and using emails to control a computer.
You can add many other features by extending this program.
